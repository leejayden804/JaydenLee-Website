          <h3>4 Years</h3>
          <p>I've been as passionate about game development as ever these last few years, especially when quarantine started. Take a look at my Unity projects down below to see my works! (Candybird 2D and Gym Jammin')</p>

          <h3>3 Years</h3>
          <p>I've educated kids ages 6-17+ coding through the art of creating video games: managing classroom settings, adapting lessons to learning styles, training new employees, and most importantly, learning new things myself are all apart of the job.</p>

          <p>Intensive 4-week program for 9 college credits in Game design, literacy, and development: collaborated with students from around the world on video/board games (see Haunted Home Designer and Scoops! games below). Loved meeting people across the globe! </p>

        <h1>Candybird 2D</h1>
        <h3>Candybird 2D was my first Unity game published on itch.io in 2022! In this hyper-casual game, you play as a bird traveling far to collect candies and avoid airplanes. Use the candies you collect in this game to purchase new skins for the bird. </h3>

Join Avery and the friendly ghosts in an effort to restore the house to what it once was many decades before.</h3>

    <h1>Gym Jammin'</h1>
    <h3>Gym Jammin' is my most recent project in 2024, where I took my love for going to the gym and turned it into a rhythm game. It's still in-progress, and I am not nearly done with it. Gym Jammin' is a casual rhythm game for players who love games like Rhythm Heaven or FNF and love going to the gym! How high can your score go? Can you get all the trophies? </h3>
